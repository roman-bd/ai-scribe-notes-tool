Technical Interview Project: AI Scribe Notes Management Tool
Overview
You will build a lightweight AI Scribe Notes Management Tool. This tool allows users to:
Create and view AI-generated clinical notes associated with patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           


Input can be either typed or audio (basic audio upload is fine; transcription can use any AI API or open-source model).


Each note is stored and associated with a mock patient.


Users can view a list of notes and click on a note to view:


The note content (transcribed/generated)


Related patient details


This tool simulates a core part of a home healthcare compliance suite, and we aim to assess your ability to implement clean, functional, and maintainable code in a familiar stack.



Requirements
Functional Requirements
Patient Record Creation (Seeded)


On first run, seed the database with 2-3 fake patients (name, DOB, ID, etc.)


Note Input


A simple frontend form to:


Select an existing patient


Upload an audio file or enter free text


Submit the note for transcription (audio) and/or generation (AI summary)


AI Processing


Use OpenAI, Whisper, or a similar service to:


Transcribe audio to text


Optionally, summarize or structure the note (e.g., “SOAP” format)


Save both raw and processed output


Note Listing View


List all notes with patient name, date/time, and preview of note


Click on a note to view:


Transcription / Summary


Patient metadata (on a sidebar or adjacent panel)


Persistence


Store patients and notes in PostgreSQL


Backend


Built in Node.js / TypeScript (Express or similar)


REST or GraphQL API


Frontend


Minimal UI using any framework or even plain HTML/CSS + JS (React preferred but not required)


Deployment


Can run locally, Dockerized setup preferred


No need to deploy to a public cloud, but AWS usage is a bonus (e.g., S3 for audio file storage)



Deliverables
GitHub repo link (public or private, with access)


Video walkthrough (5–10 min screen recording):


Explaining your setup


Demonstrating core features


Describing major architectural decisions


README.md with:


Setup instructions


Any assumptions or shortcuts taken


API documentation if needed

Notes
Feel free to use open-source libraries or AI tools to speed up development.


Focus on building a vertical slice of functionality with clean boundaries rather than extra features.


We’re evaluating both execution and how well you can ship a realistic feature in our stack.
